        <div class="grey-recipe-text"><h3>Ingredients</h3>
       <ul>
           <li>Oreos</li>
           <li>Instant Chocolate</li>
           <li>Cool Whip</li>
           <li>Milk</li>
           <li>Candy Pearls</li>
       </ul>
       <h3>Steps</h3>
       <ol>
           <li>Place pudding mix and milk into a large mixing bowl, whisk until well combined and thickened. Refrigerate for 15-30 minutes until thick.</li><br>
           <li>Place Oreo cookies into a food processor and pulse until you get crumbs. If you donâ€™t have a food processor, you can place the cookies in a large ziplock bag and roll a rolling pin over them until you have crumbs.</li><br>
           <li>Transfer Oreo crumbs into the thickened pudding bowl, stirring to combine. Fold in thawed Cool Whip until combined. Serve in bowls with little candy pearls on top and more Oreo crumbs to garnish. You can also place pudding into a piping bag with a large star tip and swirl onto your serving plate. If piping the pudding, I like to freeze the piping bag for 30 minutes before serving, so the swirls are more firm.</li><br>
           <li>Once the chocolate pudding is whisked well, cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate for 15-30 minutes to firm up.</li><br>   
           <li>Combine with 15 Oreo cookies and pipe the mixture in cupcake tins.</li>
